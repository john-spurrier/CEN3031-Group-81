<h2>Issues we planned to address:</h2>

  In this Sprint, we planned to address making user stories, to discuss how to provide these services on our website, and to begin development for our login and account
  sign-up pages by working on frontend and backend work individually. Our plan by the end of this sprint was to have a framework for the start of the account making process
  on the website so that we can implement everything else that follows it.
  
<h2>Completed:</h2>

  Between the frontend and backend teams, we were able to successfully complete a frontend framework for the login page, and we started backend development on the account
  sign-up page. We were also able to successfully complete the user stories so we could have a solid idea on what aspects we want to implement on our site.
  
<h2>Not Completed:</h2>
  
  While we were able to get some work done in both the front and backend, we didnt fully complete either the login or account sign-up pages. This was mostly due to a
  lack of communication between the front and backend, as we both decided to work on certain aspects without meeting up more than a few times, so we weren't able to
  provide a cohesive part of the project. Moving forward, we just need to ensure that we are communicating so that we can push out code that completed our set goals.
  Overall, this sprint was mostly successful though, as it gave us a general outlook on what needs to be done and how it needs to be done, as well as demonstrating a
  higher importance on the necessity of teamwork when it comes to larger projects such as these.
