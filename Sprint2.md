Work Completed:
 
In this sprint, we were able to figure out how to link two of our webpages, the home page and the login page, together. On the login page, we have it wait for the user to input their username and password, and it creates an object only if the input is valid (both a Username and Password are submitted).It also sends a message to the console with the given username and password. On the home page, at the bottom we implemented a "contact us" section that asks for name, email, and the message that the user wants to send. Similar to the login, all fields must be filled out. With this case, if a field is missing, it will send an alert that it still needs the other inputs. If all fields are filled out, it also sends an alert saying that the message was received. It then links a third webpage that thanks the user for contacting us, with a back button still linked that will return the user to the home page.

Unit tests:

For our front end unit tests, we tested to ensure that our webpage loaded properly, and that the pages were able to seamlessly connect to one another through the use of buttons and hypertexts. For our back end unit tests, we tested to demonstrate the functionality and response of the "contact us" messaging, and the login/account setup.
