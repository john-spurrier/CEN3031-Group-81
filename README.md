Requirements for running:
After all files and components are properly downloaded, as well as proper installation of go, the user must cd into the folder containing the app (in this case, the folder
should just be named 'app'). The user then runs ng serve -o in the terminal, and the application should start. On the sign up page, the username is the name entered, and the 
username and password much properly match in order to log in.
