<h1>Sprint 3</h1>
<h2>Work Completed</h2>
  <p>In this Sprint, we completed a large amount of working focusing on
primarily 2 aspects, the packages, and the registration. For the packages, we set up 3 pages for each of the purchasable packages, with each containing a title, a short description, an image, and a longer description. At the bottom of each page, there is a hypertext link that, when clicked, will bring users to the shop page. This page can also be accessed from any page by clicking the 'Store' button at the top of the app. Once on the shop page, it displays the 3 packages with a price, and each one has two buttons: a buy button and a share button. The share button doesn't have any functionality outside of sending a message saying the product is shared. The buy button, when clicked, adds the selected package to the cart. This can then be seen by clicking the cart button, which links to the cart page. Whatever packages were selected on the shop page will then be displayed here, along with their price. By clicking pay, it links to the credit page, which requests credit information. This information must be typed in, and typed with the proper format, for the submit button to allow it (meaning that the card number must be 16 digits long, the security code 3 digits, and the date 2 for the month and year respectively). For these pages to have this functionality, 4 typescript files are primarily used. The product.ts file creates a list of products that each contain an id, name, price, and description, which is then displayed using the shop html file. In the cart.service.ts file, it creates an array of products, and creates 3 functions, the addToCart, getItems, and clearCart functions. addToCart adds a given product to the array, getItems returns the array, and clearCart empties the array. The getItems function is then called in the cart.component.ts file, which sets the cart's specific instance to have an array with the given items that were selected. The shop.component.ts file also defines an addToCart function, which adds the product to the shop's cart service, which is then used to pass into the cart service array, and eventually into the cart component when it eventually calls the getItems function. These are all then implemented in the html files with buttons that call these function when clicked, which allows for the selected packages to be transferred to the cart page after being bought on the shop page. This is the main functionality of the packages and the shop. The other main focus for us with this sprint is the register page. The register page is a page that is accessed from either the main page 'Register' button, or on the login page, where there is a hyperlinked text that states that if the user doesn't have an account, that they should sign up. Once on the register page, the user is asked to input their name, email, and a password, which must be retyped correctly before allowing them to continue. After clicking the sign up button, the API that is explained below then allows for the data to be sent to a database, which is then used for the login page. On the login page, the user must input their username and password, and if the given a username that isn't in the database, or a password that doesn't match the given username is provided, the user isn't allowed to continue. If the database says that the username exists and the password is correct, they are allowed to login. In the future, we plan to have this make an actual account where certain booleans are used to determine if the user has a certain package, and if they do, for the page to display the given features. However, this isn't implemented yet, and our website only has the functionality that has been described above.</p>
<h2>List of Frontend Unit Tests</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Cypress Testing to confirm all links open to where they are routed to as well as using the spec.ts anular karma testing to make sure all text is coming up as it should in each compnent and that all text boxes and drop down selections are working and sending to the database/console./li>
  </ul>
 <h2>List of Backend Unit Tests</h2>
   <ul>  
    <li>Test Main: This function sets up the database and runs the other tests. It tests the connection to the database and migration of the user table.</li>
  <li>TestNewUser: This function tests the creation of a new user through the NewUser function. It sends an HTTP POST request to the "/users" endpoint with a username and password in the request body. It checks if the response status code is http.StatusOK and if the response body contains the expected response message.</li>
  <li>TestLoginHandler: This function tests the user login functionality through the loginHandler function. It sends an HTTP POST request to the "/login" endpoint with a username and password in the request body. It checks if the response status code is http.StatusOK and if the response body contains the expected response message.</li>
  <li>TestUpdateUser: This function tests the user update functionality through the UpdateUser function. It sends an HTTP PUT request to the "/user/{username}/{email}" endpoint with a new username, email, and password in the request body. It checks if the response status code is http.StatusOK and if the response body contains the expected response message.
</li>
  <li>TestAllUsers: This function tests the retrieval of all users through the AllUsers function. It sends an HTTP GET request to the "/users" endpoint. It checks if the response status code is http.StatusOK. The JSON response check is omitted due to the variability/volatility of the database.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Documentation for Backend API</h2>
<p>
This backend API is built using Golang and provides several endpoints for managing user data stored in a SQLite database. 
It uses the GORM library to interface with the database and allows for creating new users, retrieving all users, deleting users,
and updating user data. Additionally, it includes a login endpoint that checks user credentials against the database and returns 
a success or failure response. The API communicates via JSON and returns JSON-encoded responses. Overall, this API provides basic 
CRUD functionality for managing user data and authentication.
 </p>
<h4>List of Functions</h4>
<ul>
  <li> AllUsers: retrieves all users from the database and returns them as JSON to the client. </li>
  <li>NewUser: adds a new user to the database based on the data sent in the request body. Returns the added user as JSON to the client. </li>
  <li>DeleteUser: deletes a user from the database based on the username and password sent in the request body. Returns a response indicating success or failure. </li>
  <li>UpdateUser: updates a user in the database based on the username and password sent in the request body. Only the package status can be updated. Returns a response indicating success or failure. </li>
  <li>loginHandler: authenticates a user based on the username and password sent in the request body. Returns a response indicating success or failure. </li>
 </ul>
